// Done for testing purpose for Modernizr

/*  Modernizr does the following :-
 1. It adds classes indicating feature support, allowing you to apply different styling to elements depending on what features they support.
 2. It allows you to run feature detection to decide whether to run a script/run a polyfill or not.
 3. It injects html5shiv, which allows old browsers to understand HTML5 elements. */
